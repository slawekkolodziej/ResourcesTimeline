# ResourcesTimeline

This script uses Resource Timing API to get all the scripts, stylesheets, images, etc. requested by the page. Then all of that is represented in a timeline similar to the one you should know from the network panel in Chrome Dev Tools.

Tested on:

* Chrome 36
* Opera 23
* Internet Explorer 11
